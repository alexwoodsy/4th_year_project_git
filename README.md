# Quasars Probing Galaxy Clusters
Through studying the effect of intervening neutral hydrogen in the spectra of high redshift QSO, A
series of studies have been performed, advancing current techniques used to understand protoclusters
that coalesced under gravity to form the cosmic structures we see in the universe today. This
review analyses the preceding methods by which these structures have been studied, as well as
detailing a new line of research, first crafted for use in the study of other QSO in the line of sight
to background quasars. This work utilised this quasar probing technique
to study protoclusters by measuring absorption of their neutral hydrogen content in the spectra of
background quasars. With this, outlines for a new study in this manner is proposed, detailing the
aims, data and method for this new investigation.
