# Quasars Probing Galaxy Clusters
With the power of using the quasars probing
method in the search and study for foreground objects such as other QSO and protoclusters clearly
shown by [Hennawi et al., 2006, Cai et al., 2016],
the door has been opened for future research with
this technique. 
In our research we aim to utilise
these techniques to study protoclusters at z < 2.
Measuring the HI column density within the protoclusters to infer the structure and physical mass
distribution of these ancient structures, revealing important information about the predecessors to the galaxy clusters we see in the universe
today. To accelerate our study of protoclusters
at z > 2 a set of predefined targets signposted
by the CARLA program [Wylezalek et al., 2013]
will be used.
